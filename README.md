##  Investigation of string-based topology finding framework for structured surface patterns using computer algorithms

This research aims to address novel implementation of learning algorithms and generative design to string-based topology exploration methods. It seeks to achieve flexibility in the generation of high-performing diverse structural patterns of shell-like structures that effectively align multiple engineering objectives including mechanical and material efficiency and buildability. Through an investigation into the tailored application of reinforcement learning and genetic algorithms for connectivity design within structural patterns, both qualitative and quantitative metrics will be defined to demonstrate the strength and generality of this approach. Ultimately, the research aims to facilitate general creative exploration in structural design during the conceptual stages, emphasizing the importance of closer collaboration between form-designers and form-analyzers to harness the potential of emerging computation techniques.
